# fe_pageSplit4ward

Split the fe_page.html5 template into head, content and foot pieces. This allows you to edit the content (everything between
<body> and </body>) in a seperate file. On contao-updates, update this extension to have a new combine version of the fe_page
with all <head> and <foot> changes.


## Installation

Just copy the files to `system/modules/fe_pageSplit4ward` and run a database-update. Or use the Contao composer.

After installation you could choose the fe_pageSplit template with its head,content,foot partrs in your Pagelayout.
